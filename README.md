### What is it?
<details>
  <summary>
    tl;dr: <TODO>
  </summary>
  <br />

  A brand new package project! It's a CRUD wrapper around `localforage` or [`@brightsole/vanillite`](https://github.com/brightsole/vanillite). It will allow for a standardized way of interacting with a local store, with advanced crap like querying. It will also eventually do input validation!

  It's ready for you to add some functionality, and publish it!

#### High priority

1. stop typecasting values, use a typed insert object
1. test it
    1. create
    1. read
    1. update
    1. delete
    1. very thoroughly test querying, especially deep comparisons like `'dingle.bloop.floobo': ['niner']`
1. publish it

#### Low priority

1. refactor methods to only be CRUD, no named `createAll`, just look at inputs for _what to do_
1. allow for querying using regex queryParam properties :sparkles:
